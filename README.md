This project is a web application that allows users to upload a 32x32 image and predicts the CIFAR-10 class using a pre-trained Keras model (`cifar10_cnn.h5`).

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload a 32x32 image
- Preview the uploaded image
- Predict the CIFAR-10 class using a trained CNN model
- Display predicted class and confidence score
- Clean, modern UI with responsive design

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap or TailwindCSS), JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **ML Model:** Keras (TensorFlow backend)

## ðŸ§  Model
